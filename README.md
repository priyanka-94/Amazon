# Amazon.com - Employee Access Challenge
The objective is to build a model, learned using historical data, that will determine an employee's access needs, such that manual access transactions (grants and revokes) are minimized as the employee's attributes change over time. The model will take an employee's role information and a resource code and will return whether or not access should be granted.
I have acheived this obejective using different types of algorithms. The got the best results with my Random forest algorithm as 0.66022 as a score.
